# 🤖 Building AI Agents with LLMs

Led by instructors from **Stanford, MIT, and C3.ai**, the experience was deeply engaging with equal parts technical and inspiring. I didn’t just follow along; I built, experimented, broke things, and learned.

## What This Repository Contains

This repo is a reflection of my learning journey. Inside, you'll find:

- 💬 **Conversational AI agents** powered by OpenAI + LangChain  
- 🔍 A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot with FAISS  
- 📄 A **Document Question Answering agent** using contextual memory  

Whether you’re diving into LLMs for the first time or exploring advanced applications, I hope this gives you something useful or sparks ideas of your own.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **OpenAI API (GPT-4)** – for natural language reasoning  
- **LangChain** – orchestration framework for LLM-powered apps  
- **FAISS** – vector similarity search for RAG  
- **Python + Streamlit** – fast prototyping and interactive UIs  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – experimentation and visualization

A huge thank you to **Magnimind Academy** and the amazing instructors who led this workshop. Their clarity, structure, and real-world insights made complex concepts feel approachable and actionable.


## 💡 Final Thoughts

This bootcamp reminded me why I love working at the intersection of **AI and real-world impact**. The possibilities with LLMs are endless. But only if we keep learning, building, and sharing. If you’re working on something similar, I’d love to connect.

Feel free to fork, explore, or reach out!
